---About Puzzle Strike Randomizer---
This application is a bank randomizer for Puzzle Strike, a board game from 
Sirlin Games, currently my favorite board game. At the beginning of every game 
of Puzzle Strike, one is supposed to choose ten random types of chips (chips
are functionally cards, like what one might see from a trading card game) from 
a set of significantly more than ten. Exactly how many depends on whether one
has access to the bonus chips and/or the Shadows expansion pack. This adds a 
high degree of variability to the game; thanks to this bank randomization one is 
extremely unlikely to play with the same set of chips to work with twice. 
Unfortunately, determining these chips in a fair and random way at game time is
difficult: one has to either leave the chips disorganized in the box--which is
problematic if one wants to ever find a specific chip at a later time for some
reason--or take chips out of an ordered box and mix them up--which makes
post-game cleanup take longer. Also, creating themed games--such as favoring a
bank with a lot of attack chips, or a bank with chips that chain into one
another for long combos--that still have a significant random component is very
difficult to do with the actual physical chips.

This problem has annoyed me in past games, and I also want to learn the ins and 
outs of Android development. Thus, I'm killing two birds with one stone: this
is a project that I will actually use, and also my first Android application.

---Features, present and planned---
*COMPLETE* Produces a random list of ten chips from the Base set
*COMPLETE* Shows a picture of the chosen chips along with their names
*FUTURE RELEASE* Support the Bonus Pack chips and Shadows expansion
*FUTURE RELEASE* Options to control the distribution of different chip colors
and types. For example: specify that a given bank includes 2 reds, 1 blue, 
4 browns, 1 purple, and 2 random color chips will be possible.
*FUTURE RELEASE* Themed banks. Current ideas:
Seeing Red: Game includes many more red attack chips
Hyper Combo: Game includes more combo oriented chips
Ongoing Struggle: Game includes more chips with the Ongoing keyword
Perfect Balance: Game is forced to include at least one chip of every color
More to come as I think of different themes. 
*MAYBE EVENTUALLY?* Random Character generation. Possibly include support for 
clockwork character generation? I'm not sure how useful or popular that would 
be.
*MAYBE EVENTUALLY?* Requested features from users. (If I end up having users?)
